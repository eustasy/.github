## Reporting a Vulnerability

The team and community take all security bugs seriously. Thank you for improving the security of eustasy software. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainer at security@eustasy.org.

A maintainer will acknowledge your email within 96 hours, and will send a more detailed response within 5 working days indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be released as fast as possible to any relevant package managers.
